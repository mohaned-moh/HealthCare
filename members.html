                                <p class="right__card__p"> <span style= color:#d30400;> Who is</span> Valluvan Jeevanandam, MD, specializes in the surgical management of heart failure, and is an expert in high-risk cardiac surgery. He has performed more than 1,000 heart transplants -- including the total artificial heart -- and countless cardiac surgery procedures, including transmyocardial laser revascularization, complex valve reconstruction, and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

                                    Additionally, Dr. Jeevanandam has received national attention for his skill in performing bloodless cardiac surgery, which requires the use of precise surgical techniques to minimize blood loss during the procedure — sparing the need for a blood transfusion. Dr. Jeevanandam is a pioneer in the field of mechanical circulatory assist devices. In October 2000, he was the first surgeon in the world to successfully implant the CardioVad, a revolutionary, permanent circulatory assist device that boosts heart function in patients with severe heart failure who are not candidates for transplant.</p>

At first, the small heart raced, unable to keep up with the body’s demands and produce enough power to fully circulate blood.

                                    Then, after one week, the care team was able to take the man off a ventilator. After six months, the heart had grown to the normal size found in adults.</p>

He pioneered the use of angioplasty for treatment of heart attacks, which is now the mainstay therapy throughout the world. He has been working on new catheter-based treatments of structural heart disease, and performed the first transcaval aortic valve replacement (TAVR) through a catheter in the U.S. in 2005. Currently he is organizing new protocols to treat a deadly side-effect of massive heart attacks, known as the National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative (NCSI). This initiative has proven to increase patient survival rates from 50% to 76%.
